# CLIche Project Review & Next Steps

After reviewing your CLIche project through the provided files (README.md, MEMORIES.md, CHANGELOG.md, and plan.md), I'm impressed with the comprehensive CLI tool you've built for interacting with various LLM providers. The project has evolved nicely with features like web research, scraping, document generation, and system utilities.

## Project Strengths

✅ Solid multi-provider architecture (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Ollama)
✅ Well-structured command system with clear separation of concerns
✅ Strong web research and scraping capabilities
✅ Thoughtful file management and organization
✅ Good documentation and memory tracking
Completed Recent Milestones
1. Re-implemented file search command for finding files on the user's computer
Enhanced web research & scraping features
3. Refactored configuration management
Removed problematic providers (GitHub Copilot and llama.cpp) to improve user experience
## Recommended Next Steps
Based on your development plan and the current state of the project, here are my top recommendations for what to work on next:
### Option 1: Image Generation Command Integration
Why: This is explicitly mentioned in your plan.md and would add a compelling new capability
Implementation Path:
Create a new image command with provider integrations (DALL-E, Stability AI)
Add local generation support with Flux and SDXL models
Implement image saving, viewing, and manipulation options
Include configuration options for size, style, and other parameters
### Option 2: Template System for Code & Text Generation
Why: Would significantly enhance the utility of existing generation commands
Implementation Path:
Create a template directory structure in ~/.cliche/templates/
Implement template loading, listing, and management commands
Add template variables and custom prompts
Allow users to create and share templates
### Option 3: Interactive Mode & Command History
Why: Would improve user experience for frequent users
Implementation Path:
1. Implement an interactive shell with command history
Add tab completion for commands and options
3. Create a TUI interface for more visual interaction
Implement session management and context retention
### Option 4: Project Scaffolding
Why: Would transform single-file generation into complete project creation
Implementation Path:
Create project templates for common frameworks
Implement a scaffolding command with interactive options
Add customization options for project structure
Include dependency management and project initialization
### Option 5: Documentation Improvements
Why: Would make the project more accessible to new users and contributors
Implementation Path:
1. Create formal API documentation
2. Develop a comprehensive developer guide
Write a contributing guide
Create an FAQ based on common issues
