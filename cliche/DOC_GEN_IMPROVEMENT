The user wants me to analyze the part of the `research.py` file where complete documents are generated (not the snippet or summary sections). They want suggestions on how to improve the length and comprehensiveness of the full documents without making any changes yet.

Let me think about the areas where we could improve document length and content comprehensiveness:

1. Content extraction: Ensure we're extracting as much content as possible from each source
2. Content chunking: Review how we're splitting content into chunks for processing
3. LLM prompt engineering: Examine how we instruct the LLM to generate the document
4. Content limits: Check if there are any arbitrary limits on content length
5. Consolidation: Look at how the separate chunks are combined into the final document

# Improving Document Length for Complete/Comprehensive Mode

Looking at how the full document generation works in the research.py file, here are several approaches we could take to improve the length and comprehensiveness:

## 1. Chunk Processing Improvements

Currently, the code processes sources in chunks of 2:
```python
# Process in chunks of 2 sources at a time
chunk_size = 2
```

This chunking approach is good for managing context windows, but we could:
- Make chunk_size configurable based on depth (lower chunk size for higher depth)
- Add instructions to prioritize comprehensiveness over brevity
- Modify how chunks are combined to preserve more content

## 2. Prompt Engineering Changes

We could modify the document generation prompts to:
- Explicitly instruct the LLM to include ALL information from the sources
- Remove any language about summarization or brevity
- Add instructions to preserve technical details, examples, and code snippets
- Specify a minimum word count that scales with the amount of source content

## 3. Source Handling Improvements

For the full document mode:
- Increase the per-source character limits (currently capped in various places)
- Include more context from each source (not just excerpts)
- Add better section separation between content from different sources
- Use a different content integration approach for documentation sites

## 4. Add a "Complete/Verbose" Flag

Add a new command-line flag like `--complete` or `--verbose` that:
- Disables all summarization instructions
- Uses more direct content inclusion with minimal processing
- Preserves structure from the original documentation
- Sets higher per-chunk and total document length targets

## 5. Content Processing Logic

The content integration strategy could be improved to:
- Better preserve hierarchical structures in documentation
- Include more examples and code snippets
- Maintain relationships between concepts
- Avoid omitting "less important" sections that might be critical for complete documentation

## 6. Document Organization

For comprehensive documentation, we could:
- Generate a detailed table of contents
- Preserve the original structure more faithfully
- Use more direct quotes from the source material
- Create cross-references between related sections

Would you like me to focus on implementing any specific approach from these options?
