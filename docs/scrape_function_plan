## Updated Image Scraping Integration Plan

- [x] **Create New Image Extractor Module**
  - Created `cliche/scraping/extractors/image_extractor.py`
  - Implemented `ImageExtractor` class with async methods
  - Added proper error handling and logging
  - Implemented image metadata extraction

- [x] **Test Suite Creation**
  - Created `tests/scraping/test_image_extractor.py`
  - Implemented unit tests for core functionality
  - Created mock tests for async operations
  - All tests are now passing

- [x] **Update Core Extractors**
  - Updated `GeneralExtractor` to use new `ImageExtractor`
  - Updated `WikipediaExtractor` to use new `ImageExtractor`
  - Updated `PythonDocsExtractor` to use new `ImageExtractor`
  - Created tests for extractors
  - Fixed parameter name consistency

- [x] **Create Compatibility Layer**
  - Updated `image_scraper.py` to use `ImageExtractor` internally
  - Added deprecation warnings for direct usage
  - Ensured backward compatibility for existing code

- [x] **Documentation Updates**
  - Created migration guide (`docs/migration_guide.md`)
  - Updated README with new architecture details
  - Provided examples for using the new modules

- [x] **Integration Testing**
  - Tested with real websites (Wikipedia successfully)
  - Verified extraction with HTML-based sites
  - Identified limitations with JavaScript-heavy sites
  
- [x] **Separation of Concerns**
  - Separated scraping and document generation
  - Removed document generation from scrape command
  - Improved clarity of command responsibilities
  - Enhanced console output with stats

### Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Website Support**
   - Integrate with browser automation (Selenium/Playwright)
   - Add support for JavaScript rendering
   - Implement scrolling simulation for lazy-loaded images
   - Extract CSS background images

2. **Performance Improvements**
   - Implement parallel processing for large sites
   - Add caching for repeated requests
   - Create adaptive strategies based on site structure

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Add content-based image filtering
   - Implement OCR for image text extraction
   - Create smart cropping for image previews

### Specialized Extractors Plan

1. Implement specialized extractors for:
   - GitHub Documentation
   - Hugging Face Documentation 
   - GitBooks-style sites
   - Medium articles

2. Implement a Reddit parser with:
   - Post extraction
   - Comment hierarchy
   - Media embedding
   - User information

### Next Steps

1. Focus on specialized extractors
2. Implement Reddit parser
3. Research browser automation integration for dynamic sites
4. Improve error handling and retry logic
