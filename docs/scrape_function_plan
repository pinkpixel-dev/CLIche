  - Added deprecation warnings for direct usage
  - Ensured backward compatibility for existing code

- [x] **Documentation Updates**
  - Created migration guide (`docs/migration_guide.md`)
  - Updated README with new architecture details
  - Provided examples for using the new modules

- [x] **Integration Testing**
  - Tested with real websites (Wikipedia successfully)
  - Verified extraction with HTML-based sites
  - Identified limitations with JavaScript-heavy sites
  
- [x] **Separation of Concerns**
  - Separated scraping and document generation
  - Removed document generation from scrape command
  - Improved clarity of command responsibilities
  - Enhanced console output with stats

- [ ] **Test Crawl4AI Integration**
  - Tested with real websites (Wikipedia successfully)
  - Verified extraction with HTML-based sites

   - Add rate limiting and politeness controls for responsible scraping
   - Implement resumable scraping for large sites

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Add content-based image filtering
   - Implement OCR for image text extraction
   - Create smart cropping for image previews
   - Add intelligent depth control based on content relevance
   - Create depth visualization to show crawling progress

### Specialized Extractors Plan

1. **Existing Specialized Extractors**
   - [x] Wikipedia Extractor
   - [x] Python Documentation Extractor

2. **New Specialized Extractors to Implement**
   - [ ] **Blog/Medium Extractor**
     - Optimize for Medium, WordPress, Ghost and other blog platforms
     - Add pagination detection for complete article extraction
     - Handle author profiles and publication pages
     - Integrate with existing image scraper
     - Test across multiple blog platforms
     - Implement better extraction of dates, authors, tags
   - [ ] GitHub Documentation
   - [ ] Hugging Face Documentation 
   - [ ] GitBooks-style sites

3. **Content Processing Improvements**
   - [ ] Implement better cleanup of extracted content
   - [ ] Add smart content organization by topic/category
   - [ ] Enhance metadata extraction
   - [ ] Create specialized handling for different content types

4. **Reddit Parser**
   - Post extraction
   - Comment hierarchy

   - User information

### Next Steps

1. Implement specialized Blog/Medium extractor that works well with sites like Medium
2. Extend general extractor with multi-domain support options
3. Focus on other specialized extractors
4. Implement Reddit parser
5. Research browser automation integration for dynamic sites
6. Improve error handling and retry logic
