.SH DESCRIPTION
Durdraw
is an ASCII, ANSI and Unicode art editor for UNIX-like systems (Linux,
macOS, etc). It runs in modern Utf-8 terminals and supports frame-based
animation, custom themes, 256 and 16 color modes, terminal mouse input, 
DOS ANSI art viewing, CP437 and Unicode mixing and conversion, HTML output,
mIRC color output, and other interesting features.
.PP
Durdraw is heavily inspired by classic ANSI editing software for MS-DOS
and Windows, such as TheDraw, Aciddraw and Pablodraw, but with a modern Unix
twist.
