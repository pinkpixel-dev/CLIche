# Task: Enhanced Web Research & Scraping Features

## Intent
- Primary Objective: Add powerful web research and content scraping capabilities
- Expected Impact: Improved user access to up-to-date information 
- Business Value: Enhanced utility beyond standard LLM interactions

## Environment
- Platform: Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Stack Version: Python 3.8+
- Dependencies: 
  - Core LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
  - crawl4ai (web crawling)
  - duckduckgo-search (search API)
  - beautifulsoup4 (HTML parsing)
  - rich (terminal formatting)

## Scope
### Current State
- Basic CLI commands limited to direct LLM interaction
- No ability to research current topics
- No web scraping capabilities
- Missing professional mode for document generation

### Target State
- Comprehensive research command with web search and content extraction
- Dedicated scraping command for deep website analysis
- Document generation from scraped content
- Professional mode toggle for formal content

### Affected Systems
- Core command system
- Document generation pipeline
- Provider implementations
- Utility functions

## Technical Implementation
### Codebase Changes
File Structure:
```
cliche/
├── commands/
│   ├── research.py (+350/-0) - New research command
│   ├── scrape.py (+380/-0) - New scrape command
│   └── write.py (+30/-15) - Updated with professional mode
├── core.py (+25/-0) - Added professional mode support
├── providers/base.py (+35/-0) - Added professional mode toggle
├── providers/*.py (+15/-10 each) - Updated providers for professional mode
└── utils/
    └── generate_from_scrape.py (+350/-0) - Document generation utilities
```

### Architecture Updates
- Added professional/casual personality toggle system
- Implemented web scraping pipeline
- Created document generation from scraped content
- Enhanced error handling for web content extraction
- Added deep crawling with topic relevance filtering

### Interface Changes
- New commands: `research`, `scrape`, `generate`
- Enhanced document generation with professional tone
- Improved content output with proper formatting

## Testing & Validation
### Test Coverage
- Tested scraping against multiple websites
- Validated research command with various queries
- Confirmed document generation quality
- Verified professional mode functionality

### Quality Metrics
- Research responses include current web information
- Scraped content maintains structure and formatting
- Generated documents are well-organized and formatted
- All providers properly handle professional mode toggle

## Documentation
### Technical Specs
- Added RESEARCH_COMMAND_README.md
- Added SCRAPE_COMMAND_README.md
- Updated main README.md
- Updated installation scripts

### User Impact
- Seamless installation with all dependencies
- Clear documentation for new features
- Helper scripts for common operations
- Improved colored terminal output

## Status
- Implementation: Complete
- Testing: Complete
- Deployment: Complete

## Notes
- Some websites block web crawlers - added fallback mechanism
- Professional mode significantly improves document quality
- Consider adding PDF extraction in the future
- Consider adding more specialized web extraction templates
