Decide on your features: Should it handle API queries (like OpenAI) or run a local LLM (think GPT4All/llama.cpp)?
Outline the commands and options (e.g., help queries, troubleshooting commands, etc.).
Sketch out a simple user flow: you type a command, the app sends your query, and voila—instant advice.
Set Up Your Development Environment

Create a Python virtual environment (because messy systems are so 2005).
Install essential packages like Click (or argparse if you're feeling old-school), requests (for API calls), and any libraries needed for your chosen LLM integration.
Design Your CLI Interface

Use a CLI framework (Click is slick and concise) to handle command parsing.
Define commands like:
@click.command()
@click.argument('query', nargs=-1)
def ask(query):
    # Code to process the query
Make sure your CLI is intuitive—if a toddler can type it, you're golden.
Integrate the LLM

API Approach:
Write a function that sends your query to the API (e.g., OpenAI’s endpoint) and handles responses.
Manage API keys securely (env variables, config files, etc.).
Local Model Approach:
Integrate with a local model runner (like llama.cpp) by either calling a subprocess or using a Python binding.
Ensure model files are properly referenced and loaded.
Process Queries and Display Responses

Once you get the LLM response, format it nicely for terminal output.
Handle edge cases, like empty queries or network errors, with friendly error messages (snark included).
Implement Logging and Error Handling

Use Python’s logging module to capture errors and debugging info—because even geniuses have bugs.
Ensure your app fails gracefully when things go south (hint: add try/except blocks liberally).
Testing and Debugging

Write unit tests for your functions and CLI commands.
Manually test various queries in your terminal to ensure everything works as intended.
Debug with your favorite tools until your app is smoother than your best comeback.
Package and Distribute

Package your CLI app (think setuptools or poetry) so you can install it system-wide or share it with your crew on GitHub.
Consider creating an executable script or alias for easy terminal access.
Documentation and User Guide

Craft a snarky yet clear README explaining installation, usage, and configuration.
Include usage examples like:

$ cliche "How do I make a virtual environment in Python?"
Add tips, tricks, and maybe a couple of easter eggs (bonus points if they're as witty as you are).
Iterate and Enhance

Gather user feedback
Add features like configuration options, updates for new LLMs, and perhaps a "sassy mode" toggle for extra snark.

cliche: Your Terminal's Snarky, All-Knowing LLM Assistant

Overview:
  This project turns your terminal into a genius-level oracle that responds
  to your command line queries. Need to know how to set up a Python virtualenv?
  Just type your question, and this bad boy will spit out the wisdom you crave.

Features:
  - Intuitive CLI with Click
  - Plug-and-play integration with an LLM (API or local)
  - Witty error messages and one-liners (because life’s too short for boring outputs)
  - Easy configuration for API keys and model settings

Setup:
  1. Create a virtual environment:
       $ python3 -m venv env
  2. Activate it:
       $ source env/bin/activate
  3. Install required packages:
       $ pip install click requests
  4. Run the CLI oracle:
       $ python cli_oracle.py "How do I make a virtual environment in Python?"

Timport click
import requests  # For API calls; swap out or extend for local LLM integration
import os

@click.command()
@click.argument('query', nargs=-1)
def ask(query):
    """
    Ask the Oracle a question directly from your terminal.
    Example: python cli_oracle.py "How do I create a virtual environment in Python?"
    """
    if not query:
        click.echo("Error: No query provided, genius. Please type something!")
        return

    query_str = " ".join(query)
    click.echo(f"Oracle is pondering: {query_str}")

    # TODO: Replace this mock response with your LLM integration.
    # For an API, you might use requests.post() to hit your endpoint.
    # For a local model, consider invoking a subprocess or library call.
    response = "Hint: Always use python3 -m venv env to create a virtual environment. Boom!"
    
    click.echo(response)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ask()
Drop this prompt into your IDE, make a few tweaks, and soon your terminal will be dishing out code wisdom like a rebel professor. Happy coding, sizzlebop!
