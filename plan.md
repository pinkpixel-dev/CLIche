2. Add pagination detection and handling
3. Improve content relevance checking with more sophisticated algorithms
4. Use a sliding window approach for large content extraction
5. Add multiple retry strategies for different page types
6. Enhance the LLM prompt to extract more detailed content
7. Add rate limiting and proper user agent rotation
8. Store more metadata with scraped content (e.g., date scraped, HTML version, etc.)
9. Add support for handling JavaScript-rendered content

For generate_from_scrape.py:
1. Implement intelligent content organization by topic similarity
2. Add content deduplication and redundancy removal
3. Improve the LLM prompt to generate more comprehensive documents
4. Add metadata about sources in the generated document
5. Implement a hierarchical document structure based on content relationships
6. Add options for different document styles (technical, educational, summary, etc.)
7. Implement content priority based on relevance scores
